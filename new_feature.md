The new feature I attempted to add was an nth-root function that allows users to calculate the nth root of a number. This is a reasonable feature to expect in a frontend project because it doesn’t require backend processing; JavaScript can easily handle this operation using built-in math functions. Given that the project is a calculator, it's logical to include this simple yet important operation. The feature was designed to work by allowing the user to press a button to apply the root operation to a base number. The user would then input the exponent, and when they pressed the equal button, the result would be displayed. Unfortunately, ChatGPT failed to implement this feature correctly three times. Each time, the operation failed during testing and didn’t work as expected. Initially, it implemented the function, but the result was incorrect. After I provided further instructions to correct the result, the code seemed to adjust accordingly, but the function stopped working altogether. When I tried to start over with my original code, I couldn’t get the function to work at all, unlike before. Each iteration failed. Based on what I could tell, the nth-root operations isn't being applied to the HTML code properly, despite me giving the format of the HTML and trying to adjust the HTML code and the JS accordingly.
